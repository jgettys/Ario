# Ario

This is the mechanical design for ATMoB's ARIO telescope dome.  It was
designed by Charlie Gettys in the spring of 2016, and fabricated by
Charlie & Jim Gettys and Bruce Berger.  Note that we are currently designing
a radio controlled motor controller as a companion to this piece.

Note: the specified threaded rod was ordered by mistake: it is gross overkill
for the application; something much cheaper can/should be bought rather than
the precision rod currently specified in the as built BOM.
